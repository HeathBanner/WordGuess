# Word Guess

[Click to play!](https://heathbanner.github.io/WordGuess/)

The Word Guess game is an astonomy-based, word guessing game. The user is given a word that's been scrambled with random icons. On the left of the main area will be a "Hint". This will help the user guess what the word is. 

You start off at "Level 1". From here, you have 10 guesses. If guessed correctly, the letter will appear in the appropriate position within the scrambled icons. Each guess will be logged with in the "Letters Guessed" area. This, along with your guesses, will refresh once you hit the next level. 

If the user runs out of guesses they will be prompted with a message:

>"You've run out of guesses! Press 'ok' to restart."

This will restart the game and another attempt to successfully finish can begin.
